# React Native - Meteor Boilerplate

A starting point for integrating a React Native app with a Meteor app. I've used this file structure in large, multi-developer projects.

_Note #1:_ This project only specifies an opinion on the *React Native* project architecture.

_Note #2:_ I generally split the React Native app and Meteor app into separate repositories. That's just personal preference. You can keep them in the same repo, as shown here, if you wish.

## Getting started with Meteor

1. Make sure you have [Meteor]() installed.

## Helpful Commands

From the `RNApp` directory:

- `npm run ios`: Open the app in Xcode and start the packager.
- `npm run androird`: Start the app in the android sim?
